=head1 SYNOPSYS

    my $id = Games::RailRoad::Window::Train->spawn(%opts);
    $kernel->post( $id, 'visibility_toggle' );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

GRW::Trains implements a POE session, creating a Tk window listing the
trains existing in the simulation. The window can be hidden at will.



=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 my $id = Games::RailRoad::Window::Train->spawn( %opts );

Create a window listing trains, and return the associated POE session
ID. One can pass the following options:


=over 4


=item parent => $mw

A Tk window that will be the parent of the toplevel window created. This
parameter is mandatory.


=back



=head1 PUBLIC EVENTS

The newly created POE session accepts the following events:


=over 4

=item visibility_toggle()

Request the window to be hidden or restaured, depending on its previous
state. Note that closing the window is actually interpreted as hiding
the window.


=back
